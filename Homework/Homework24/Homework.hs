Question 1
Rewrite the Tic-Tac-Toe game from lesson 23 such that two users can input
their game choices instead of the computer randomly picking them. 

In addition to that implement a check functions that in every turn checks
wether a user has won the game and notifies the players about it.

Use monadic functions to implement this game. No need to use a State monad.
